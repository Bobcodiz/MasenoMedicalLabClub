                        The Maseno Medical Laboratory Science Students' Association (MMLSSA) was established in June
                        2024 by first- and second-year Medical Laboratory Science (MLS) students at Maseno University.
                        Under the leadership of Sam Brian, then chairperson of the Medical Students' Association of
                        Maseno (MEDSAM), MMLSSA was created to foster unity among MLS students and support their
                        academic and professional success. The association focuses on securing sponsorships for key
                        student events and provides financial assistance to students in need, helping them cover tuition
                        and essential expenses

                        MMLSSA serves as a crucial link between MLS students at Maseno and the larger medical laboratory
                        science community. It connects members with national organizations like the Kenya Medical
                        Laboratory Science Association (KEMELSA) and the Kenya National Union of Medical Laboratory
                        Officers (KNUMLO), as well as international MLS associations, enabling collaboration and
                        knowledge exchange. Through its mentorship initiatives, MMLSSA helps members grow both
                        personally and professionally, offering guidance as they navigate the challenges of medical
                        education and their future careers.
